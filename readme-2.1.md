Okay, I guess tetris games are almost as plentiful as AOL CD's and telemarketer calls,
so why do you need a new one?  Well, Cowtris may not differ from those other games in
many aspects, but there is one:  Mighty few of the others feature our bovine friends.

Well, maybe that's not a very compelling reason, but all the same we hope that
you'll enjoy Cowtris and spend many happy hours in blissful bovinedom.  If you do
enjoy it, please take the time to tell your friends and to let us know what you
think.

This latest version 2.1 of Cowtris adds as a bonus several new, special cows: the Mad Cow,
the Holy Cow, and the Purple Cow.  Each has a special effect which you can read about in
the Instructions.  In addition, several minor bugs from version 2.0 have been corrected.
